                <p>
                    This website was built for the purposes of learning and applying that knowledge in a real project.
                    <br></br>
                    I had never before done anything regarding web development, nor had I any experience with Javascript, but it was a fun project where I learned a lot.
                    It was done without any framework, it is just plain vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
                    <br></br>
                    Data is fetched from chess.com public API and then displayed for the user. 
                    <br></br>
                    The grid that shows the info for each of the games is a class that I've created and extends HTMLElement.
                    After fetching the data, we add our rows through appending on the shadow DOM.
                    Also, we the wait for the "DOMContentLoaded" event to fire in order to garantee we already have our grid instantiated
                    <br></br>
                    The website is also fully responsive and we used media queries for that.
                    <br></br>
                    Overall, this was a short, but very important project that allowed me the learn the basis of web development and give me the confidence to move into more complex projects.
